This project was done by Nwafor Kingsley and Aswin Gunasekarn

The use of css file helped reduced complexity and length code that would have been used when styling each individual layout, button, etc.

The FXMail2020 was designed in such a way it validates email typed in the textfield "To" and "From" when the "Send" button is clicked
If the validation is false, it clears the text field for "To" and "From" and prompts a warning alert
If the validation is true for both, a comfirmation alert pops up indicating sent.

It uses a contact list view by clicking the "..." button, which displays a new stage to select contacts from by selecting the contact and click "ok" button

The "Quit" button closes the application.
